      ## **DAO Governance - Proposals and Voting Processes**


      Governance is one of the key elements of any organization. It provides
      leadership and direction to the strategy of the organization. Before DAOs,
      organizations operate a centralized system where people are employed to
      take decisions on behalf of the whole organization. This means that
      decisions taken by Executives determine how the organization grows and if
      it fails, they also take responsibility for it.


      However, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), operate a
      transparent system where rather than have a few people take all the
      decisions, the community work together by sharing and discussing ideas,
      developing proposals for ideas formed, and having them voted upon. If the
      proposal is valuable to the community, it is voted for and approved by the
      community for implementation and if it is not, then it is discarded.


      This is one of the reasons DAOs are considered the future of organizations
      as they are inclusive, democratic, and transparent.


      ## **Challenges with Fully Decentralized DAOs**


      A DAO by its basic definition is a decentralized entity. Anyone can be a
      member if interested in what the DAO is building and contribute their
      skills and time to the growth of the DAO. It also gives them the
      opportunity to come up with proposals that will develop further, the area
      of interest of the DAO.


      Today, DAOs have tens of thousands of members within their communities
      that are actively involved in shaping the future of the DAO. Now, imagine
      the time it will take if every member of the community comes up with a
      proposal and everything is to be decided by the community. The DAO may
      never be able to finish up as it will take a lot of time to go through all
      the proposals and vote on them.


      Also, certain activities are strategic while some are trivial so creating
      proposals for every process or activity within the DAO would not yield
      many results considering the time put into developing it, hence the need
      for Councils.


      Finally, if the process becomes too tedious or lacks value, participation
      becomes quite low and this gradually defeats the concept of
      democratization in DAOs.


      ## **Councils**


      The Council Structure in DAOs is a system that selects or elects a
      specified group of people to serve as leaders of the community so as to
      manage high-level processes as well as monitor work progress. A number of
      DAOs are using this model since it makes work more sustainable (putting
      responsibilities on the members of the Council) and is widely accepted by
      Governments. 


      By having a Council structure, some of the proposals that would have taken
      the community a long time to approve due to conflict of ideas are done
      within record time. Also, strategy and execution within DAOs are aligned
      within a particular direction that the Council has taken. Different DAOs
      have various names for their Councils, however, the function remains the
      same.

      ## **Governance Policies**


      This guide will give you an understanding of different Councils in various
      projects and how they are applied within their communities. The DAOs we’ll
      be looking at are three (3) DAOs that form the [Community
      DAO](https://gov.near.org/t/near-community-fund-vision-strategy-and-governance/4631)
      in the NEAR ecosystem namely:


      * Creatives DAO Council

      * Community Squad DAO Council

      * Marketing DAO Council


      While covering some policies from four (4) DAOs from other networks such
      as:


      * Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Stewards

      * Synthetix Spartan Council

      * Index Coop Council

      * Gitcoin Stewards


      ### **Creatives DAO Council**


      Creatives DAO focuses on providing funding to creative works done within
      the NEAR ecosystem. They manage the process involved in screening
      proposals and ideas that will encourage more creative people to join the
      community as well as promote the works of others. 


      Some areas that this DAO covers are music, art, virtual reality, events,
      promotions, etc. If the work is in some way related to a work of
      creativity and is to be built on the NEAR Blockchain, then this DAO is the
      place to go.


      Creatives DAO has a
      [Council](https://gov.near.org/t/closed-open-call-creatives-dao-council-5-positions-results-soon/11966)
      whose functions are highlighted below:


      * Create polls for all council members to vote

      * Carry out voting exercises within the allocated timeframe

      * Ensure that guidelines for submitting proposals are followed

      * Engage with off-chain proposals in the Forum when it’s necessary

      * Communicate with the community off-chain on request

      * Communicate with the Creatives Guild Leaders on Telegram as well as
      engage all introductory posts from prospective Guild Leaders.

      * Host and attend weekly Creative Leaders Meetup


      Further duties of the Council can be found
      [here](https://gov.near.org/t/break-down-of-council-duties-for-each-council-members/26975).


      #### **Requirements**


      * The candidate must have submitted at least 2 successful proposals to the
      Creatives AstroDAO or to another Vertical's AstroDAO.

      * Worked as a Council member in another DAO

      * The candidate should be active on the Creative Guild Telegram Chat and
      Governance Forum (in the Creatives category).


      More information on the Creatives DAO Council can be read
      [here](https://gov.near.org/t/creatives-dao-guidelines-community-draft/29851).


      ### **Community Squad DAO Council**


      The Community Squad DAO is the community that manages the governance
      processes within the NEAR ecosystem. They are involved with providing the
      voting process and requirements, funding community projects, determining
      what proposals should go through, etc.


      Community Squad DAO operates a Council structure where members manage the
      process of funding ideas and guilds activities with the NEAR ecosystem in
      a transparent manner. This involves reviewing proposals twice a week and
      voting on the project to know whether or not it should be funded by the
      NEAR community.


      If the proposal exceeds 4 days, Council members get a message and if there
      are discrepancies, a discussion is held to resolve it. The Council is made
      up of 12 members who have contributed greatly to the NEAR ecosystem. More
      information bout them can be found
      [here](https://gov.near.org/t/community-squad-dao-council-an-introduction/4608).


      ### **Marketing DAO Council**


      Also, the marketing DAO is committed to ensuring that there is a system in
      place to ensure that the NEAR ecosystem continues to grow as it funds
      projects and ideas that will enable that in various parts of the world.
      From social media content to meme creation to events and meetups to growth
      hacking activities and more. The DAO continues to work with members of the
      community to reach new people.


      The [Marketing DAO
      Council](https://gov.near.org/t/discussion-marketing-dao-council-members-remuneration/7808)
      is a group of people who oversee the functions of the Marketing DAO within
      the NEAR ecosystem. It is made up of 3 NEAR core team members and 2
      community members. The functions of the council are highlighted below:


      * Increase awareness of what NEAR is and encourage people to come onboard

      * Work with the NEAR core team to approve funds requested for
      marketing-related activities

      * Receiving, assessing, and voting on proposals

      * Meet with project leaders to discuss their proposals, ask questions for
      clarity, and make amends where necessary.

      * Work with all approved projects and follow up on progress reports.

      * Submit reports on work done by the Council

      * Communicate with other Council members for at least 1 hour per week.


      #### **Requirements**


      * The Council is open to anyone applying, however, anyone interested in
      being a part of the Council must be deeply involved in the NEAR ecosystem
      in terms of contributing to the growth of the ecosystem. 


      * The ideal person should have an understanding of the trends, players,
      risks, and opportunists in the ecosystem to be able to assess proposals.


      The Marketing DAO is currently on pause as the Council works to come up
      with a more sustainable approach to operations in the DAO. Read more on
      this
      [here](https://gov.near.org/t/announcement-temporary-pause-and-review-to-marketing-dao/30223).

      ### **ENS Stewards**


      Ethereum Name Service is the decentralized naming system for wallets,
      websites, etc. on the Ethereum Blockchain such that rather than have long
      wallet addresses, users can use any name of their choice with a domain
      extension of “.eth”.


      [Ethereum Name
      Service](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep12-social-working-group-rules/12953)
      (ENS) is operated by an open community led by stewards who manage working
      groups in the DAO. They are elected to lead working groups for two terms
      which last for a year. Every working group elects three stewards while
      having one lead Steward for the period.


      Just like Councils in DAOs in the NEAR ecosystem, stewards at ENS have the
      following functions


      * They are responsible for requesting funds from the DAO

      * They are responsible for overseeing the operations of working groups in
      accordance with the DAO's constitution.

      * Approve the creation of subgroups and workstreams as the case may be.

      * Disburse funds to the working group when necessary

      * Act as key stakeholders in working group multi-sig.


      #### **Requirements**


      * People who want to be a steward can nominate themselves or anyone else
      who they feel is qualified for the role. 

      * They must also get at least 10,000 signed votes to stand on the ballot
      for election.


      ### **Synthetix DAO Spartan Council**


      Synthetix is a DeFi protocol that provides synthetic assets on the
      blockchain based on real-world assets. The issuance of these assets is
      based on smart contracts developed by Synthetix known as “Synths” which
      are easily traded on Synthetix’s decentralized exchange.


      This structure came as a result of the challenges faced with the
      transition of voting from Discord to Snapshot. The major challenge was
      that there was a major difference between both processes in that on
      Discord, one member had one vote while on Snapshot, holders of a large
      amount of SCCP tokens had more votes.


      So, the [Spartan
      Council](https://blog.synthetix.io/spartan-council-proposal/) was set up
      to ensure that this challenge is solved. As a result, a group of people
      were selected as part of the Council and were tasked with the following
      responsibilities:


      * Approve proposed changes to the Synthetix protocol

      * Vote on proposals created in the DAO

      * Communicate with other council members on Discord and debate topics
      openly


      #### **Requirements**


      * The requirement for being a Spartan Council is to first be a member of
      the Synthetix community, then nominate yourself for the role and stand in
      for the election. Any member of the community who is then voted as part of
      the top seven in the election becomes a member of the Spartan Council.


      ### **Index Coop Council**


      Index Coop is a DeFi protocol that gives people the chance to own and hold
      indices of various cryptocurrencies rather than owning them separately to
      reduce the risk of loss for investors and traders.


      [Index
      Coop](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/v2-index-council-contributor-vote-update/3958)
      operates a Council structure that allows the Council members to work for a
      six (6) month period and have the following functions:


      * Provide a high-level strategy for the community to work around.

      * Hire contributors for projects needed to be worked on.

      * Approve budget and funding required as and when due

      * Ensure the community (Nests) deliver based on the strategy of the DAO

      * Approve core team compensation changes

      * Determine contributors' rewards approach


      #### **Requirements**


      To be a member of the Council, the person must be a Gold, Silver, or
      Bronze Owl (Level) in the Index Coop ecosystem and will nominate
      themselves via a Governance Forum post with the following information:


      * What they think Index Coop’s strategy should be

      * What is their stance on resource allocation, that is, the level of
      overall spending, any Nest, Pods, or initiatives which should receive more
      or less funding

      * What their stance is on delegation of decision-making, that is, what
      activity would they like to see the Council focus on, what activity would
      they like to see delegated

      * Why they think they would make a good Index Council nominee


      ### **Gitcoin Stewards**


      Gitcoin is the community of builders, creators, and protocols at the
      center of open web ecosystems. To achieve this, Gitcoin is creating a
      community and infrastructure for Web 3, that involves a diverse range of
      tools, technologies, and networks that enable people to work for the open
      internet.


      This is done by funding projects, building community, and making learning
      resources accessible, we are teaming up to create the digital public
      infrastructure of tomorrow.


      [Gitcoin
      Stewards](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41) are
      members of the community with the responsibility of ensuring that the
      project is run smoothly. As a Grant giving organization, the Gitcoin core
      team thought about the process it takes the community to award grants as
      well as manage funding processes and how to make it more transparent. The
      core responsibilities of the stewards include:


      * Setting grants round categories and sizes (how much funding should go to
      a matching pool for core infrastructure as compared to community or
      media?)

      * Determining what kinds of public goods to work on

      * Defining what kind of behavior counts as a Sybil attack or collusion
      (when is collusion just squads vibing)

      * Finding credibly neutral ways to display grantees so that everyone has
      an equal shot at being funded

      ## **Recommendation**


      Governance in DAOs still remains nascent and the choice to either operate
      as a direct democratized system or an indirect one through Councils is
      evolving for DAOs. However, the Council Structure looks like a great way
      to manage operations in a DAO in order to coordinate activities such as
      approving projects, funding, and other duties required to keep the DAO
      working.


      It also makes the DAO to be more focused in terms of what needs to be done
      in that, rather than have every member of the community bringing up ideas,
      a set of people will be assigned to do that thereby reducing time to
      market for most work that needs to be done.


      There are some ideas that could be explored when considering having
      representatives are highlighted below:


      * Councils do not have to be imposed on the community but should be voted
      by the community so they are trusted and the members who vote them in feel
      seen and heard.

      * Also, DAOs could have units within the DAO for various functions and
      then allow the members of those units to choose people who would become
      their representatives in the Council. This ensures a balanced
      representative system in the DAO.

      * Another area to consider is finding ways to reserve Council seats for a
      specific group. An example where this could work will be when there are
      some minority members of the DAO who would not be able to sponsor a
      representative. This approach allows for fairness and transparency which
      is the ethos of DAOs.


      In making sure that the Council structure works well, one measure that can
      be taken having a fixed term for the Council to operate (maybe a six-month
      period) so that when that time comes, another set of people can be elected
      to serve in the Council. Also, the burden of performance should be on the
      Council members where there is a review of performance and if after a
      period of time, the community does not feel that the representative has
      worked well in their favour, then the person can be voted out and replaced
      by another person.


      In the end, the Council structure is not perfect since there is a
      possibility of leaders taking bad decisions on behalf of the DAO.
      Synthetix is exploring [Version 3 Governance Module
      (V3GM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2fGO9FSvQk)) that allows for
      hierarchy in governance where token holders are above the Council and can
      collectively override the Council in the event of a decision that is not
      in alignment with the community.

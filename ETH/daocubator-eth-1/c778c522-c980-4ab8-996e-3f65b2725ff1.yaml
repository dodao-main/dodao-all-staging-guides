      ## **The Evolution of DAO Voting**


      The idea of having a DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is
      that decisions are made through voting by the community or members, rather
      than by a central figure. This concept of decentralization is not new and
      can be seen in various structures and organizations such as governments,
      social groups, and corporations. What is new, however, is the application
      of this idea to the digital world. By using blockchain technology, DAOs
      can exist entirely online and function without a central authority. This
      allows for a more democratic and transparent decision-making process that
      can be beneficial for all parties involved.


      Traditional organizations usually have a board of directors and an
      executive team that makes decisions on behalf of everyone within the
      organization. For example, when a company wants to strategize for growth,
      these people, usually, C-suite executives decide what should happen and
      how it should be implemented. When the decision is made, it is expected
      that the team goes ahead to implement what has been decided. Many times,
      members of staff feel left out of key decision-making processes that may
      impact their functions. Other times, leaders take bad decisions because
      there was no process for the general team to vote on decisions made. This
      is the challenge of making decisions in a fully centralized environment.


      Organizations that want to maintain a healthy workplace culture typically
      spend a lot of money making sure employees feel like they are valuable
      stakeholders in the company. By making all of these decisions in a
      transparent way organizations can:


      1. Develop trust

      2. Have transparency

      3. Buy-in from employees and making them feel like stakeholders

      4. Employee empowerment

      5. Get early product feedback

      6. Develop better decision-making in most cases 


      Although this is typically the case for most organizations, there are
      always exceptions to the rule - like in the cases of Tesla or SpaceX,
      where a different model might be more beneficial.  


      DAOs are becoming more popular because they allow everyone to have a voice
      in the decision-making process. With DAOs, proposals can be recommended
      and voted on via smart contracts. This open process of decision-making
      enables all members of the organization to be heard.


      Since DAOs are a relatively new concept, there have been a lot of
      conversations about how they should handle voting processes. Some DAOs
      operate purely decentralized systems, while others are beginning to take a
      hybrid approach. To understand how DAOs are dealing with decision-making,
      we need to look at the various voting strategies that are currently in
      place. This
      [article](https://medium.com/votingdao/importance-of-dao-voting-system-and-latest-development-b0a620801f68)
      provides an introduction to governance in DAOs, explaining the role of
      DAOs in the current landscape and why they are gaining popularity. It
      covers the basics of what DAOs are, how they operate, and what benefits
      they offer.

      ## **DAO Voting Strategies**


      As DAOs increase and grow, the voting strategies used in many DAOs also
      evolve. However, before knowing the trends of voting in DAOs, we’ll take a
      look at the different voting strategies adopted by DAOs today to achieve
      the goal of creating a truly decentralized economy. Some of these
      strategies have been highlighted in articles such as
      [limechain.tech](https://limechain.tech/blog/dao-voting-mechanisms-explained-2022-guide/)
      and [code2.io](https://www.code2.io/blog/web3-dao-voting-mechanisms/). 


      Listed below are the types of voting strategies that exist:


      * Token-Based Voting

      * Quadratic Voting

      * Meta Governance

      * Council Voting

      * Conviction Voting

      * Holographic Consensus

      * Voting Vaults

      * Rage Quitting



      ### **Token-Based Voting**


      This is the most basic form of voting in DAOs. It is also one of the most
      popular strategies used by DAOs to get people to vote on proposals. The
      way it works is that DAOs roll out a native token that will be bought by
      the community and people who own these tokens can participate in the
      voting process of the DAO. Usually, projects set up minimum voting
      participation criteria. 


      An example of this is stating that at least 5% of all token holders must
      participate in the voting process for all proposals. This minimum
      criterion is regarded as a quorum so for every voting process, a number of
      people need to vote on a proposal for that process to pass or fail. If the
      threshold is met, then the decision of whether the proposal passes or
      fails will be noted. However, if the threshold is not met, then the
      proposal fails automatically. The more tokens owned by a member of the
      DAO, the more votes the person or organization can wield.


      [Aragon DAO](https://aragon.org/how-to/set-your-dao-governance) explains
      how you can apply the token-based voting strategy on its platform when you
      are setting up a DAO. For Aragon, 1 token equals 1 vote which shows why a
      member of the DAO may need more tokens to be able to have more votes.
      [Maker DAO](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/)
      also implements the token-based voting strategy on its platform.


      ### **Quadratic Voting**


      For this type of voting strategy, it goes beyond just owning tokens for
      the sake of being able to vote but owning tokens because the quality of
      every vote is the square root of the number of tokens owned. This means
      that for people who own four (4) or twenty-five (25) tokens, the power of
      their votes is two (2) and five (5) respectively. 


      It encourages a power balance since you’ll need to own a significant
      number of tokens to influence decision-making and also encourages voter
      participation. This
      [article](https://blog.tally.xyz/a-simple-guide-to-quadratic-voting-327b52addde1)
      explains further how quadratic voting works and how it can be applied in a
      DAO.


      The Founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin has discussed this type of voting
      in [this article](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html)
      and a web3 community such as
      [Gitcoin](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-might-we-decentralize-gitcoin/8734)
      is already experimenting on the process of quadratic voting.


      ### **Meta Governance**


      This type of voting strategy is usually for DAOs that hold tokens of other
      DAOs and are permitted to vote on the proposals of those other DAOs
      whenever there is a need for it. The DAO creates a proposal, which is then
      posted on Snapshot. Other DAOs can view the proposal and vote on it within
      a specified time period, typically 24 hours. The outcome of the vote
      becomes the position of the DAO. One way this has been applied is that a
      meta-governance committee is put in place to focus on voting on proposals
      from other DAOs on behalf of the DAO.


      A typical DAO that has implemented this model successfully is [Index
      Coop](https://docs.indexcoop.com/governance/meta-governance) where the DAO
      has indices that are made up of various other tokens in one thereby giving
      them the opportunity to hold tokens of various other DAOs. This also puts
      them in a position to vote on their proposals as one entity.


      ### **Council Voting**


      Councils in DAOs are generally set up to aid the process of decision
      making which can be really slow when the whole community is supposed to
      vote on proposals. With Councils, people with expertise in specific areas
      can be voted in by the community to vote on certain strategic decisions
      for the DAO. This approach is a hybrid structure with terms where people
      serve and hand over to other people to continue. Also, if council members
      do not perform, they can be removed and replaced by others. 


      In some DAOs, these people serve as multi-sig and also approve finances
      for projects and handle decisions that might otherwise take weeks to get
      done if it was opened to the community. DAOs within the [NEAR
      ecosystem](https://gov.near.org/t/near-community-fund-vision-strategy-and-governance/4631)
      have adopted this structure and more DAOs such as
      [Synthetix](https://blog.synthetix.io/spartan-council-proposal/) and
      [Gitcoin](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41) are
      also working with the council structure to make decisions faster.


      ### **Conviction Voting**


      Conviction voting is quite simple. It is a process of voting that gives
      the community the opportunity to vote based on their conviction about
      proposals that should be approved. In a continuous process, people can
      change their positions and vote to favour other proposals but this comes
      with a price. If you decide to change your vote, then the weight of the
      vote decreases. 


      The weight of the vote is determined by the aggregated preference of the
      community members measured continuously. As long as your preference for a
      particular proposal remains, your conviction increase over time and you
      have more influence than people who may just come in for the purpose of
      influencing the direction of the vote.


      This helps reduce the chances of large token holders creating last-minute
      changes that can affect the outcomes of votes. It is a new voting strategy
      and is still being experimented on across a few DAOs. To learn more about
      this type of voting and how it can be applied in a DAO, read [this
      article](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475).
      It gives a clear breakdown on what conviction voting is and how it works.


      ### **Holographic Consensus**


      Voting in DAOs can be quite time-consuming, as every day there are debates
      or votes on various proposals. This can be quite hectic for community
      members, and it may not feel sustainable in the long run.


      In order for a proposal to pass, a quorum of 1000 members needed to vote
      for example, at least 501 of them need to vote in favor of the proposal.
      Imagine doing this for every proposal - it would quickly become clear that
      this approach of absolute majority is not scalable. So, one of the ways
      DAOs are beginning to think about combating this challenge is introducing
      [holographic
      consensus](https://medium.com/daostack/holographic-consensus-part-1-116a73ba1e1c)
      (a concept driven by DAOStack) as a way to vote on proposals. 


      This voting mechanism proves that a relative majority would be much more
      effective than an absolute majority. For example, if only 100 people out
      of 1,000 eligible people voted on a proposal, the side with the most votes
      from those 100 people would be the verdict on the proposal, rather than a
      quorum of the 1,000 people. However, in order to select the proposals that
      would be considered, proposals need to be boosted by the initiator, which
      is essentially committing an agreed amount of DAO tokens for it to be
      considered by the community.


      Then predictors can stake their prediction tokens that a proposal will be
      accepted by the DAO or stake that a proposal will be rejected by the DAO.
      If the DAO passes a proposal, then those that predicted in favour of that
      proposal will be compensated while those that staked against it will lose
      their tokens. This
      [article](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/daostack/voting-options-in-daos-b86e5c69a3e3&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1668789211033394&usg=AOvVaw0e4Cq2OG2F6OQiNmULHU67)
      explains how holographic consensus works in detail.


      ### **Voting Vaults**


      This is a type of voting strategy where users can stake their tokens into
      some known protocols such as Compound or AAVE as collateral and still be
      able to vote on proposals in the DAOs whose tokens they hold. This concept
      is basically about being able to maximize capital efficiency. 


      Some of the ways Element is experimenting with voting vaults include the
      following:


      * The Compound/Aave Vault is a great way to use your tokens as collateral
      and/or earn interest while still maintaining voting power. Voting power is
      based on the supply and demand of lending, so it's important to keep that
      in mind when using this tool.

      * LP Vault to get voting power while providing liquidity.

      * The Ouroboros Vault is a great way to deposit Element principal tokens
      or non-governance, protocol tokens to get more votes than your current
      balance. This is a great way to increase your voting power and make sure
      that your voice is heard on the platform.

      * L2-L1 Synthesis Vault: L2 posts balance tree hashes and L1 votes using
      the merkle balance proof of L2.

      * DAO Merger Vault: Gives token holders of other protocols the ability to
      vote.

      ## **Pros and Cons of Voting Strategies**


      All the voting strategies discussed above are basically experimentation
      since they are not perfect and of course, have strengths as well as
      limitations. Some of them deal with the issue of open voting by the
      community while some are focused on getting expert opinions on proposals
      as the case may be. In the table below, we shall look at the pros and cons
      of all the different voting strategies discussed and things to note when
      using them.

      </li>

      </ul>
         </td>
         <td>
      <ul>

      <li>This process takes a lot of time since community members need to vote
      on every proposal in the DAO.

      <li>It also gives room for voter apathy as many people may be tired of
      continuously voting on all proposals.

      <li>Finally, people with large amounts of tokens may take over the process
      since the number of tokens determines the number of votes so people with
      few tokens may not be able to influence any changes or sponsor a proposal
      in the DAO.

         <td>
      <ul>

      ## **Tools for managing Voting Processes**


      A number of solutions are available for managing these voting processes
      and we will be highlighting them below:


      * Snapshot

      * Quadraticvote.co

      * Gardens

      * DAOStack

      * Boardroom

      * Tally


      ### **Snapshot**


      [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org) is a gasless decentralized governance
      system where people can create and vote on proposals in their DAOs. It
      avails the opportunity for different voting types based on organizational
      needs. Some of the voting types supported are single-choice, approval, and
      quadratic voting. It also allows for flexible voting options where people
      can vote via ERC20 tokens, NFTs, and other smart contracts. DAO can also
      customize their own space to fit their brand and votes signed are easily
      verifiable online.



      ### **Quadraticvote.co**


      [Quadraticvote.co](https://quadraticvote.co/) is a platform that hosts
      quadratic votes. On this platform, DAOs can experiment with the process of
      quadratic voting by providing the mathematical system required for
      democratic voting in DAOs.


      ### **Gardens**


      [Garens](https://gardens.1hive.org/#/home) is a solution developed by
      [1hive](https://1hive.org/) that aids the process of conviction voting as
      explained in this guide. On Gardens, users can join a DAO, create a
      proposal, and vote on proposals of DAOs of which they are a part. Since
      the process is not time-based, the aggregate position of the DAO is
      recorded throughout the lifecycle of the DAO. Gardens make this process
      seamless and provide an easy-to-use user interface.


      ### **DAOStack**


      [DAOStack](https://daostack.io/) is a tool for setting up and launching
      DAOs. The type of voting strategy that it supports is holographic
      consensus and it pushes to solve the problem of vote scalability and
      resilience in DAOs.


      ### **Boardroom**


      [Boardroom](https://boardroom.io/) also provides a single interface to
      help DAOs manage their governance processes in a very easy and fast manner
      such that members can vote on proposals easily and determine what DAOs to
      add to their portfolios. Votes can also be delegated on the platform
      easily.


      ### **Tally**


      With [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/), users can create proposals, vote on
      them, delegate them to a third-party, and view previous proposals
      on-chain. It is a governance and voting tool for DAOs to make their
      processes simple and accessible to everyone within their communities. On
      Tally, each member gets one vote so it solves the problem of whales having
      more influence due to the number of tokens they own.

      ## **Conclusion**


      As we have learned in the course of this guide, voting is an important
      part of any DAO since it is how progress is made. There are a lot of
      improvements going on with the DAOs vote and what strategies they apply.
      It is important to note that all the strategies will not work for every
      DAO so what can be done is to test different strategies at different
      levels of growth within the DAO and see what works best.


      This is the way to ensure that you do not stay stagnant because you have
      decided to stick with one strategy. It calls for innovation and localizing
      the strategy to your DAO type and function to derive maximum utility for
      the process.

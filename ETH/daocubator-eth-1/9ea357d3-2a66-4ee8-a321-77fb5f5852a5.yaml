      ## **Introduction**


      Treasury management is one of the key aspects of running DAOs. According
      to [Trade
      Brains](https://tradebrains.in/features/best-practices-for-dao-treasury-management/#:~:text=DAO%20Treasury%20Management%20is%20a,especially%20during%20its%20early%20stages.),
      it involves the rightful allocation of funds in the DAO towards achieving
      its operational and sustainable goals so as to avoid liquidation,
      especially in its early days. There are various areas to consider when
      studying the concept of DAO treasury management including tokenization and
      non-tokenization of DAOs, funds safety and storage, investments and
      diversification, token swaps between DAOs, reporting, and analysis of DAO
      funds, payments, etc. 


      DAO Treasury management is a very broad and evolving term. Just as
      managing funds in an organization is very contextual and varies from one
      organization to another, the same applies to managing funds in a DAO. For
      small organizations, the goal could be to ensure that the funds are
      managed towards the survival of the organizations while bigger
      organizations tilt towards the sustainable growth of the organization. A
      good example of this is understanding that the fund management strategies
      at an investment firm are completely different from a small organization
      providing local services. However, for both cases, one common factor is
      the fact that the funds generated should be kept safe irrespective of
      their functions.


      Traditional organizations store their funds in banks since banks provide
      some form of security to the funds. For DAOs, the case is different. DAOs
      do not need a regulated body to serve as security to the funds in its
      treasury but should pragmatically keep their funds safe to enable proper
      asset management. What this entails is that the safety of the treasury in
      a DAO is mostly dependent on the DAO and not on a bank as is the case in
      traditional organizations. A few ways to keep the treasury in your DAO
      safe are highlighted below:


      * Multisigs

      * Diversify Treasury

      * Analytics Dashboards

      * Financial Reporting


      ### **Multi Sigs**


      Cryptocurrencies are stored on blockchain wallets with unique addresses.
      These addresses are the alphanumeric codes used when funds are to be
      deposited into the wallet. When this wallet address is lost, private keys
      are used to retrieve the wallet and the funds in it. In the past, people
      have lost access to funds in their wallets because they lost their private
      keys and could no longer access their wallets. Also, funds have been lost
      when hackers find their way into the wallet and eventually clear out the
      funds in the wallet. For personal wallets, these losses may not be a lot,
      however, when organizations such as DAOs are involved, this could be
      catastrophic. 


      How then do you reduce the risk of loss of funds in the DAO treasury?
      Multisigs is a way out of this challenge. Multisigs are basically multiple
      signatures required for a transaction to be completed in any wallet. So,
      instead of requiring one address to sign the transaction, multiple wallet
      addresses will be required. A DAO could set up a multi-sig by having more
      than one wallet address as part of the multi-sig and can even ensure
      consensus by deciding how many must be available for any transaction in
      the DAO to be completed. This is usually done by putting a condition that
      the majority of the multi-sig must approve any transaction for a transfer
      to occur and by so doing, the safety of the treasury is optimized.


      For example, let’s say DAO X has a multi-sig with five (5) members.
      However, it has been set that if three (3) out of the five (5) member
      addresses are available, then they can sign a transaction on behalf of the
      DAO. If two (2) wallets are available, then the transaction will not be
      initiated. This keeps the funds in the treasury safer than when only one
      wallet address is used.


      ### **Diversify Treasury**


      The treasury of many DAOs today is made up of native tokens that are
      highly volatile and can respond to market movements. When there is a bear
      market, the value of native DAO tokens can depreciate thereby
      automatically reducing the value of the treasury. This loss in value can
      be as high as 80% and this is not a safe way for DAOs to keep their funds.
      DAOs can diversify their treasuries by taking some steps to own
      stablecoins alongside their native tokens. However, selling off their
      tokens for stablecoins may also look like dumping the tokens and will
      still drag down the value of the tokens. 


      Some strategies that DAOs may apply when diversifying their treasuries
      are:

      * Earning revenue in stablecoins: DAOs can charge in stablecoins for their
      services so they can plan their spending based on the revenue generated.

      * Invest native tokens: DAO can enjoy benefits such as earning stablecoins
      when they stake their tokens on some exchanges.

      * Borrow stablecoins: By borrowing stablecoins, DAOs can use their native
      tokens as collaterals thereby increasing the number of stablecoins they
      hold over time.

      * Partnerships: By partnering with other DAOs or other notable
      organizations, DAOs can swap their native tokens for stablecoins or other
      tokens and not worry about getting dumped on by short-term holders as is
      the case with selling to the general public. These organizations can hold
      the tokens for a long period of time and this will bring some stability to
      the structure of the DAO.

      article](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/why-daos-need-to-diversify).


      ### **Analytics Dashboards**


      An analytics dashboard helps the DAO to know everything that is happening
      in terms of the growth of the DAO. If you are not able to measure certain
      metrics, it would be hard to know if the DAO is performing well or not.
      This is why it is encouraged for DAOs to have a system that tracks the
      core metrics in the DAO such as the amount left in the treasury, the
      number of DAO members, the number of people voting on proposals, what the
      funds are being spent on, and so on.


      The analytics dashboard in any DAO should give you a quick overview of the
      DAO's performance using numbers, charts, and graphs.


      ### **Financial Reporting**


      In traditional organizations, financial reporting gives a breakdown of the
      plan the organization has in terms of how it intends to generate cash,
      earn revenue, show profit and loss, and determine the balance sheet of the
      organization. Calculating these values is based on financial data stored
      for a period of time. This data is usually only open to the organization
      involved. For DAOs, transactional data is open to the public since these
      transactions happen on the blockchain. However, that these transactions
      are visible does not mean financial transparency as not many people will
      be able to convert those transactions into a financial report.


      DAOs need to take initiative in reporting their finances clearly so it is
      transparent and makes sense to the public. By doing this, DAOs can plan
      for future investments and commitments, know the state of their cash
      flows, and know the financial health of the organization. This measure
      will not only keep the DAO safe but will also help investors, token
      holders and community members know how the DAO is faring generally. This
      [article](https://mirror.xyz/kishans.eth/xnWnTf255vtW00zSK72safttPiAmMuZD7AM32rf1mdE)
      gives further insight into the financial reporting roadmap for DAOs.

      ## **Why DAOs Manage Treasuries**


      There are various reasons DAOs have treasuries and since we have looked at
      how to keep the treasuries safe, we will now look at the different
      activities that a treasury is needed for within a DAO and the tools for
      it. From setting up the DAO to running the DAO in the long term, funds are
      either deposited or transferred for all types of activities which could
      include having a grant program that sponsors projects within the community
      or liquidity programs that enable the DAO to raise funds to finance its
      activities among others.


      There are four main areas this guide will be looking at to help you know
      the major functions of your DAO treasury and the tools required for
      setting them up. The areas are highlighted below:


      * Raising Funds

      * Holding Assets

      * Payments

      * Analytics and Reporting


      We will now look further into each of these areas highlighted above for
      better understanding.


      ### **Raising Funds**


      The process of raising funds for traditional organizations is closed to a
      certain group of people who are either angel investors or venture
      capitalists (VC). With this, only a few people get to own stakes in
      companies until they go public which is usually at a later stage in the
      lifecycle of the organization. Even when organizations try to crowdfund
      their projects, they are forced to use centralized platforms like
      Kickstarter or Gofundme whose rules are very strict and may not be
      available to all countries. With DAOs, this process can be democratized
      from the onset. DAOs can raise funds by allowing members of the community
      and the general public to own parts of the DAO by investing and getting
      tokens as a result. Also, DAOs can manage the end-to-end process without
      the rigours of contracting by using tools to facilitate the process.


      A good example of a tool that DAOs can use when raising funds is
      [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/). On Juicebox, there are four core
      elements of fund management that can be done. You could start by raising
      funds, then giving ownership to those who fund your project or DAO,
      allocate funds for certain functions right there on the platform, and
      finally, build trust from the community. Juicebox is built on Ethereum and
      requires you to connect your wallet to be able to raise or contribute
      funds to any DAO on the platform.


      [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) is also an awesome tool for raising funds
      within the decentralized writers' economy. On Mirror, people publish web3
      content to the general public and readers subscribe to newsletters or
      general writeups by paying from their Ethereum wallet. This way, writers
      are able to generate funds for their ideas and also own the content shared
      on the platform. As a web3 native environment, Mirror is encouraging more
      people to not just be writers but to own their content while getting paid
      for it.


      Another tool that web3 companies and DAOs can leverage in their
      fundraising process is [Fairmint](https://www.fairmint.com/). Fairmint
      allows people to raise funds on SAFEs from their platform without the
      hassles of documentation. Fairmint gives you an opportunity to not just
      raise from the community but also from VCs if you need to. You can
      basically move from launch to IPO by enjoying the benefits that Fairmint
      provides.


      ### **Holding Assets**


      Once the process of fundraising is completed, the funds raised or assets
      such as tokens owned by the DAO need to be held and managed adequately.
      This is probably one of the most important parts of treasury management as
      you need to ensure that assets held are utilized properly and are stored
      securely in order to avoid theft. One of the best ways to hold these
      assets is by deploying Multiple Signatures a.k.a multi sigs. As explained
      previously, multi-sigs allow for multiple people to sign any transaction
      before the transaction is complete.


      Many DAOs that are built on Ethereum today use [Gnosis
      Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) to hold assets since it has a very powerful
      multi-sig technology known as **Safe. **Safes are smart contract wallets
      that are built on the Blockchain and support some networks where more than
      one person can sign transactions. Some reason DAOs trust Gnosis Safe is
      because it is highly secured as all the smart contracts that make up the
      safe has been formally verified. This is the highest security standard for
      Ethereum-based protocols. It is also big on privacy so names and wallet
      addresses are not exposed. As an open-source protocol, people can now
      build out more interesting products by just using available APIs from
      Gnosis Safe.


      [Coinshift](https://coinshift.xyz/) is also a great tool for managing
      treasuries and holding assets for DAOs and companies. As software that is
      powered by Gnosis, it is helping many organizations to effectively manage
      their funds from a single interface. With features such as asset swaps,
      setting spending limits, and making quick transfers, Coinshift is
      positioned as one of the best treasury management tools available.


      ### **Payments**


      In the world of DAOs, members can be up to 10,000 people within a
      particular DAO. Imagine, what it would feel like to make payments to each
      of these people based on different levels of work done in the DAO by
      making individual transfers. I’m sure it would be hectic especially when
      contributors need to be rewarded for work done in the DAO. This is why
      there is a need for payment tools to aid processes such as this. Let’s
      take a look at some tools that can help you manage your payment needs in
      your DAO.


      The first tool we will be looking at is called
      [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/). Coordinape is the go-to platform
      for all things compensation in web3. A place where you can coordinate
      payments to contributors, collaborators, and team members easily. It is
      the backbone of many DAOs when it comes to collaboration toward getting
      rewards for work done. If you are asking about who should get rewarded the
      most? What type of work should be done in the DAO? How to get people to
      share a common purpose while getting paid for it? Then, Coordinape is your
      answer!


      Also, [Parcel](https://parcel.money/) is another beautiful tool for
      processing payments in DAOs. It is the payment operating system for the
      contributor economy. On Parcel, DAOs can create accounts and make payments
      to a large number of people with one click. This process is unbelievably
      simple and is used by a lot of DAOs to reward their contributors. Other
      benefits of using Parcel include:


      * Payroll workflows

      * Battle-tested Multi-Sig

      * Payment Requests from contributors

      * Receive contributors’ profile


      [Disperse](https://disperse.app/) is also a tool for managing block
      payments to multiple wallet addresses. However, it does not offer any
      other function outside of making payments hence should be used for that
      only. It is built on the Ethereum Blockchain and supports some other
      tokens on mainnet.


      For managing payroll and expense management in DAOs, one tool that comes
      to play is [Utopia](https://www.utopialabs.com/). Some of the activities
      your DAO could use Utopia for include payroll management, managing
      expenses, organizing contributors, gasless transactions, maintaining
      transparency, and ensuring compliance.


      Finally, [Multis](https://multis.co/) is a financial software that
      provides a payment gateway for paying with crypto or USD, accounting
      services, and corporate cards for web3 organizations and DAOs. Multis
      allows integration with third-party tools such as Quickbooks and Gnosis
      Safe and can track features on multiple blockchain networks.


      ### **Analytics and Reporting**


      As the treasury of every DAO grows, one thing that needs to be done is to
      set up analytics and reporting to track the inflow and outflows of funds
      as well as measure key indices that give insights into the performance and
      growth of the DAO. This is a new space and a number of experiments are
      ongoing to help DAOs properly record financial data which is already open
      on the Blockchain but in a more systematic and summarized way.


      A leading tool to effectively build an analytics dashboard is
      [DeepDAO](https://deepdao.io/organizations) which aggregates various DAOs
      and ranks them based on metrics such as treasury size, number of token
      holders, number of lifetime participants, proposals, and so on. The cool
      thing about DeepDAO is that DAOs can connect to their API and build out
      their own in-house analytics tool.


      A major tool deployed across various DAOs for analytics and reporting is
      [Dune](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards). Dune provides dashboards for
      DAOs to showcase and report the funds in their treasuries including their
      major and minor holdings. It also shows the balance in the treasury. On
      Dune, you can build a dashboard for your DAO to record the financials of
      the DAO at a glance. You can also monitor the fund's movements on a daily
      basis.

      ## **Conclusion**


      Treasury management is and will continuously be an important part of DAOs
      because more DAOs will either raise money from institutional investors or
      from token sales to the community. Whichever approach is taken, the funds
      generated will have to be managed properly and this is why there are
      ongoing conversations about how DAOs should manage their treasuries
      effectively and safely so as to avoid unnecessary losses.


      This guide has explained how anyone who wants to set up a DAO can keep
      their treasuries safe. It has also looked at different tools that can be
      used to set up various aspects of the DAOs treasury to ensure everything
      runs smoothly. It is very important to take note of the points highlighted
      in your journey toward building a sustainable DAO.

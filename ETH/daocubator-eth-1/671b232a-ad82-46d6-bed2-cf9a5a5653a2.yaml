      ## **Introduction**


      A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that exists on the
      Blockchain. DAOs are the future of organizations because they allow
      anyone, from anywhere, to become a member just by joining the community
      and contributing to the success of the DAO.


      DAO members can work on tasks at their own timing or pace, and can also be
      placed within committees. They can sponsor proposals or vote on proposals,
      allowing them to be a part of the decision-making process. This gives
      members a high degree of autonomy, which is one of the defining
      characteristics of a DAO.


      There are certain components that are required to set up DAOs and they
      include:


      * Governance

      * Treasury

      * Members


      Governance is set up so that members can vote on proposals (be it on-chain
      or off-chain). It also shows what proposals have been agreed upon. A
      Treasury is needed to manage the funds of the DAO. From it, every type of
      payment activity which could be to individual contributors or projects is
      made while members are groups, committees, or councils that work towards a
      common goal in the DAO.


      However, one major challenge that is faced when setting up DAOs is that
      there are different tools for various functions such as Treasury
      Management, Onchain Voting, Proposal creation, and so on. Also, many DAOs
      run on networks that have high gas fees and this can affect the operations
      of the DAO in the long run. 


      This is why Astro is really important as it is a complete application for
      setting up and managing DAOs on the NEAR Blockchain. On Astro, you can
      create a DAO, set up custom function calls to perform specific functions,
      vote on proposals, manage treasury, verify participants, and much more.
      Built on NEAR, Astro also takes away the pain of high gas fees in the
      management of the DAO.

      ## **Setting Up DAOcubator University on Astro.**


      Astro is a tool for setting up and managing DAOs on the NEAR Blockchain.
      On Astro, you can create a DAO, set up custom function calls to perform
      specific functions, vote on proposals, manage treasury, verify
      participants, and much more. Built on NEAR, Astro also takes away the pain
      of high gas fees in the management of the DAO.


      In order to create a basic DAO on Astro, the following are needed:


      * A NEAR wallet with a minimum of 5 NEAR (you should have more than that
      due to fees)

      * The DAO name, purpose, link, and socials

      * The DAO Type (Foundation, Club, Corporation, or Cooperative)


      In this guide, we shall be signing up **DAOcubator University** (A DAO
      that teaches startups and communities learn how to build and scale as a
      DAO) on Astro. 


      To get started, get a NEAR wallet [here](https://wallet.near.org/) and
      follow the process followed below:

      1. Open [Astro DAO](https://app.astrodao.com/) and connect your NEAR
      wallet.

      2. Click on “Create new DAO”

      <div align="center">

      <img

      alt="Create New DAO" />

      </div>


      3. Input the DAO name (in this case, we’ll input DAOcubator University).
      The link to the DAO will read as daocubator-university.sputnik-dao.near.
      Once that is done, input the purpose [A brief description of the DAO]

      <div align="center">

      <img
      src="https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/blob/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/DAO_Name_and_Purpose_new.jpg"
      alt="DAO Name and Purpose" />

      </div>


      4. Next is an optional field for KYC to note if the DAO (DAOcubator
      University) is a legal entity.

      <div align="center">

      <img
      src="https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/blob/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/KYC.jpg"
      alt="DAO KYC" />

      </div>


      5. Provide the website and social links like Twitter, Discord, etc. (if
      available). It is also optional

      <div align="center">

      <img
      src="https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/blob/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/Links_and_Socials.jpg"
      alt="DAO Links and Socials" />

      </div>


      6. Add groups to the DAO. An example is the Council (which is added by
      default). You could add new groups if you need to.

      <div align="center">

      <img
      src="https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/blob/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/add_groups.jpg"
      alt="DAO Groups" />

      </div>


      7. Add members to the DAO as you sign-up or do this later

      <div align="center">

      <img
      src="https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/blob/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/add_members.jpg"
      alt="DAO Groups" />

      </div>


      8. Set how proposals will be created and the rights available in the DAO.
      You can choose between “Council” or “Public” or both.


      Note: If you select Council alone, only those set as Council members will
      be able to create proposals in the DAO. However, if you also select
      “Public” then anyone with a NEAR wallet can create a proposal.

      <div align="center">

      <img
      src="https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/blob/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/Proposal_Creation.jpg"
      alt="Proposal Creation" />

      </div>


      9. You can also set voting rights given to groups in the DAO.

      <div align="center">

      <img
      src="https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/blob/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/Voting_Permissions.jpg"
      alt="Voting Permissions" />

      </div>


      10. Finally, create DAO assets by uploading the logo and banner of the
      DAO.

      <div align="center">

      <img
      src="https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/blob/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/create_DAO_Assets.jpg"
      alt="Create DAO Assets" />

      </div>


      After completing all the steps highlighted above, Click on “Create New
      DAO” and then the work is done! Congratulations, we have created
      DAOcubator University as a DAO on Astro. Next is to explore the core
      features of Astro DAO.

      ## **Core Features on Astro**

      <div align="center">

      <img
      src="https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/blob/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/core_features.jpg"
      alt="Core features on Astro" />

      </div>


      Navigating the new DAO on Astro is quite simple and there are some core
      features that you should know about.


      * **Drafts**: These are unpublished content which could be proposals,
      bounties polls, etc. All drafts are shown on this tab


      * **Proposals**: A proposal is an idea that community members may want the
      DAO to implement. They are written, reviewed, and submitted for voting
      based on the unique processes of the DAO. On this tab, you can check the
      proposals that have been created and their status.


      * **Funds**: Here, Astro gives you a full view of the funds owned by the
      DAO. All funds received into the DAO show up on this tab. At this point,
      only the 5 NEAR deposited when signing up will be seen.


      * **Members**: Every participant that joins the DAO is a member. The
      members are placed into groups based on their level of responsibilities in
      the DAO. These groups could be committees, councils, or working groups. On
      this tab, you can see the members of the DAO in their groups.


      * **Settings**: Here, the DAO sets the rules that back the operations of
      the DAO.


      * **NFTs**: Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique tokens on the Blockchain
      that cannot be traded like cryptocurrencies. They can, however, be sold or
      held. Simple examples of NFTs are cryptographic artworks where only one
      person can own the artwork at a time. You can view the NFTs owned by the
      DAO here.


      * **Bounties**: Bounties are tasks where many members compete to win an
      amount by coming up with the best work. Here, you can see the bounties
      created by the DAO if there are any.


      * **Polls**: Just like bounties, polls are created to get the opinions of
      the members of the DAO. Any poll created in the DAO can be seen on this
      tab.
